        Example workflows for MIA can be found in the
        <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mianalysis/mia-examples"> mia-examples </a>
        repository. These introduce various processes of MIA such as image loading, object segmentation,
        object measurements and relationships and visualisation. Each example contains the necessary
        files to get it running: the example workflow, any raw images required and any example outputs
        that are generated by the workflow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each module in these workflows includes a corresponding set of notes summarising the purpose
        of that module and its configuration. These notes can be viewed by enabling the "Notes"
        panel ("View {'>'} Show notes panel" from the MIA menu) and selecting a module from the list
        of modules in
        <a class="link" href="/guides/editing-view"> editing view </a>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        While these workflows correspond to a specific analysis, the principles covered (i.e. image
        loading, processing, object detection and measurements) are applicable to most workflows.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: Any object outlines in the generated "overlay" images will typically only be visible
        when opened in ImageJ/Fiji.
