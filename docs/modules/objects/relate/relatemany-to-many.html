    <p class="text-center mia-main-text">Relate objects of two classes based on spatial proximity or overlap.  With this module, each object from a collection can be linked to an unlimited number of other objects (see "Relate many-to-one" and "Relate one-to-one" modules for alternatives).  As such, the assigned relationships can form a network of relationships, with each object connected to multiple others.  Related objects are assigned partner relationships and can optionally also be related by a common cluster (parent) object.  Measurements associated with these relationship (e.g. a record of whether each object was linked) are stored as measurements of the relevant object.</p>
