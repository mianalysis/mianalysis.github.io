    <p class="text-center mia-main-text">Relate objects of two classes based on a variety of metrics (e.g. spatial overlap or proximity).  The assigned relationships are of the form many-to-one, where many input "child" objects can be related to at most, one "parent" object.  Measurements associated with this relationship (e.g. distance from child to parent surface) are stored as measurements of the relevant child object.</p>

The exact distances used (e.g. centroid to centroid or surface to surface) are controlled by the "Reference point" parameter.</li><li>"Spatial overlap" Children are related to the object from the parent collection they have the greatest spatial overlap with.

These distances are always positive; increasing as the distance between centroids increases.</li><li>"Child centroid to parent surface" Distances are from child object centroids to the closest point on parent object surfaces.  These distances increase in magnitude the further from the parent surface a child centroid is; however, they are assigned a positive value if the child is outside the parent and a negative value if the child is inside the parent.  For example, a centroid 5px outside the object will be simply "5px", whereas a centroid 5px from the surface, but contained within the parent object will be recorded as "-5px".</li><li>"Surface" Distances are between the closest points on the child and parent surfaces.  These distances increase in magnitude the greater the minimum parent-child surface distance is; however, they are assigned a positive value if the closest child surface point is outside the parent and a negative value if the closest child surface point is inside the parent.  For example, a closest child surface point 5px outside the object will be simply "5px", whereas a closest child surface point 5px from the surface, but contained within the parent object will be recorded as "-5px".  Note: Any instances where the child and parent surfaces overlap will be recorded as "0px" distance.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="mia-table-text-bold">Limit linking by distance</td><td>When selected, objects will only be related if the distance between them (as calculated by the "Reference point" metric) is less than or equal to the distance defined by "Maximum linking distance (px)".</td></tr><tr><td class="mia-table-text-bold">Maximum linking distance (px)</td><td>If "Limit linking by distance" is selected, this is the maximum permitted distance between objects for them to be assigned a relationship.</td></tr><tr><td class="mia-table-text-bold">Inside/outside mode</td><td>When relating children to parent surfaces it's possible to only include children inside, outside or on the edge of the parent.This parameter controls which children are allowed to be related to the parents.
