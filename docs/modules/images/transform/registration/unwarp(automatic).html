    <p class="text-center mia-heading">Description</p>
    <p class="text-center mia-main-text">Apply slice-by-slice (2D) B-spline unwarping-based image registration to a multi-dimensional stack.  Images can be aligned relative to the first frame in the stack, the previous frame or a separate image in the workspace.  The registration transform can also be calculated from a separate stack to the one that it will be applied to.  Registration can be performed along either the time or Z axes.  The non-registered axis (e.g. time axis when registering in Z) can be "linked" (all frames given the same registration) or "independent" (each stack registered separately).<br><br>This module uses the <a href="https://imagej.net/BUnwarpJ">BUnwarpJ</a> plugin to calculate and apply the necessary 2D transforms.  Detailed information about how the BUnwarpJ process works can be found at <a href="https://imagej.net/BUnwarpJ">https://imagej.net/BUnwarpJ</a>.</p>

These reference frames are consolidated into a single reference image using a projection based on the statistic specified by "Previous frames statistic".  This mode copes better with image sequences which continuously evolve over time, but can also lead to compounding errors over time (errors in registration get propagated to all remaining slices).</li><li>"Specific image" All images will be compared to a separate 2D image from the workspace.
