    <p class="text-center mia-main-text">DEPRECATED: Please use separate automatic and manual modules instead.<br><br>Apply slice-by-slice (2D) affine-based image registration to a multi-dimensional stack.  Images can be aligned relative to the first frame in the stack, the previous frame or a separate image in the workspace.  The registration transform can also be calculated from a separate stack to the one that it will be applied to.  Registration is performed along the time axes and applied equally to all Z-slices.  For greater control (including registration along Z) please use separate automatic and manual modules instead.<br><br>This module uses the <a href="https://imagej.net/Feature_Extraction">Feature Extraction</a> and <a href="https://imagej.net/Linear_Stack_Alignment_with_SIFT">Linear Stack Alignment with SIFT</a> plugins to detect SIFT ("Scale Invariant Feature Transform") features from the input images and calculate and apply the necessary 2D affine transforms.<br><br>Note: The SIFT-algorithm is protected by U.S. Patent 6,711,293: Method and apparatus for identifying scale invariant features in an image and use of same for locating an object in an image by the University of British Columbia.
